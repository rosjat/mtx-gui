# mtx-gui


This will be the "new" version of mtx-gui so it's not fully functional right now.
But as you may noticed it's going in a different direction then the master branch.
It aims to use the python-scsi package (https://github.com/rosjat/python-scsi) but
it will offer a fallback to the mtx tool if python-scsi package is not installed.

## Updates

### 2015-10-04
since python-scsi now supports python 3 I started to organize the dev branch so I get a nice base for
the next steps to come. MediumChanger is now a pyscsi.SCSIDevice.

I also changed dev_mr to the default branch!

### 2015-10-06
the gui can at least be started now, as long as you are doing it as root for the dev access and you should have
a media changer or at least as iscsi target set up with tgt (for example)

### 2015-11-08
Just some minor changes in the GUI, it start to look a bit nicer now.

### 2015-11-14
Ok its basically working now, added code for the load and unload of the slots.
It's in a dev stage still but with this codebase it should at least do the things
the old gui have done now. Well except the statusbar but this is going to be implemented
as soon as this version is working "well".
